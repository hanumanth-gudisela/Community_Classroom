PROBLEM STATEMENT: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
{1,2,3,2,3,1} - true
{1,2,3,4,4,5}
false
=========================================================================

Miising number ?

[1,2,3,4,6]
public class Missing{

int arr[] = new int[]{1,2,3,4,6};
  int sum = n*(n+1)/2;

for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
  int sum2 = sum2+arr[i];
  
  int difference = sum1-sum2;
===============================================================================  
 In interface we have methods but no method implementation,
 so how do you use method reference?

==========================================
difference between map() and flatmap() ?
map() is usually useful for one-to-one mappings, while flatMap() is more useful for flattening one-to-many mappings.
============================================== 
Difference between hashset, treest, linkedhashset?
Can not contain duplicate items: All HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet are implements Set interface. So they are not allowed to contains duplicates elements or objects.
Not Thread Safe: All three are not synchronized and hence not Thread safe.
Cloneable and Serializable: All three (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet) are Cloneable and Serializable.
fail-fast Iterator: All three will returne fail-fast Iterator. That is, ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown, if you try to modify the Iterator object after creation.
=================================================
When to use HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet:
Use HashSet: When there is no need to keep any order in elements but group of unique objects is needed.
Use LinkedHashSet: When group of unique elements is needed and insertion order of elements is also required.
Use TreeSet: When group of unique items/elements/objects is needed and sorting of the elements is required according to some Comparator.
==============================================
what if we have  2 elemnets which same hashdcode?
   
difference between == and .equals ?
what is the o/p for a.equals(b) for the given input strings?
   
   a,b
   a==b,
============================================================  
Explain immutablity ?
when you want to use mutable object in immutable class as variable then deepcloning,and swallowing concept comes into picture
   
I have mutable class as address how do you use this in immutablity class and if i make any changes in address class should not reflect in Immutable class?
=============================================================   
multiple inherence wont support becuase of ambiguity
=============================================================  
   a,b,   
   c nullPointer exception propagation,
===============================================================   
   try{
   }
   catch{
   exception // all eceptions can be hanlded
   }
   catch{
   arthimetic exception
   
parent child relationship in exceptions?
======================================================================   
when you want to use/call particular method in yml file/application.properties we need to use @Condtional, @Property annotations?
===========================================================================   
interface implement 2 class b,c to avoid ambiguity  we can use @qualifier  annotation?
=============================================================================  
what is dependency Injection and types ?
=============================================================================  
Difference between post and put ?
